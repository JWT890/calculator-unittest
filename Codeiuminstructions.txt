To get good unit test results with the Codeium extension, you have to say something along
the lines of "Write me a unit test in "desired unit test language" from@nameofFile for
name of the function you want to be unit tested. It will give you an output of code to use
to unit test and will want to unit test to see if there aren't any errors with the code
since there are errors that pop up and will need to either look up the errors to resolve them,
type the error in the respective chat with Codeium, or put it into Bard/ChatGPT to resolve the
error with the unit test code. Otherwise thats about it for unit testing, you can also ask it
to code programs as well if you want to.
